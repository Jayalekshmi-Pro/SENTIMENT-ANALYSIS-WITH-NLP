This task focuses on building a machine learning pipeline to perform sentiment analysis on a dataset of customer reviews. The goal is to classify each review as either positive or negative using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.The entire process will be carried out in a Jupyter Notebook, showcasing the key stages of a machine learning project: data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and performance evaluation. The classification will be done using a Logistic Regression model, and text data will be transformed into numerical format using TF-IDF Vectorization.

Steps to be Performed:

1.Import the Dataset :Load a dataset containing customer reviews and their corresponding sentiments (1 for positive, 0 for negative).

2.Preprocess the Text Data :Clean the review texts by converting to lowercase, removing punctuation, links, numbers, and unnecessary symbols to prepare it for vectorization.

3.Split the Data :Divide the dataset into training and testing subsets to train and evaluate the model properly.

4.TF-IDF Vectorization :Use the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) method to convert raw text into numerical vectors. This technique helps highlight the most important words in each review relative to the dataset.

5.Model Training with Logistic Regression :Apply Logistic Regression, a widely used classification algorithm, to learn from the training data and predict sentiments of the test data.

6.Evaluate the Model : Measure the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. These metrics help determine how well the model is classifying positive and negative reviews.

7.Test with Custom Reviews (Optional) : You may include sample reviews to manually test the modelâ€™s predictions for real-world insight.

Deliverable:

The final output should be a Jupyter Notebook that clearly demonstrates: The cleaning and transformation of raw text data ,TF-IDF vectorization process ,Training and prediction using Logistic Regression , Visualization of evaluation metrics (e.g., confusion matrix) and A few sample predictions for interpretability
